✅ How to properly open your project in VS Code:
For example, to open your "Ve Meet TEST" folder:
Open VS Code.

Click on File → Open Folder...

Select:
C:\projects\Ve Meet TEST

Click Open.

You will now see all folders and files in the Explorer panel (left side).

💻 To open a terminal in VS Code:
Go to the top menu:
Terminal → New Terminal

A terminal will open at the bottom, already inside your folder (e.g. client or server).

Now you can run:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start       # in client folder
node server.js  # in server folder
🔁 Summary:
Task	Use VS Code?	Use Notepad?
Open/edit JavaScript files	✅ Yes	🚫 No
Run server or client	✅ Yes (terminal)	🚫 No
Copy/paste code correctly	✅ Yes	⚠️ Often breaks lines in Notepad

So yes — always open and run your project inside VS Code. Let me know if you want me to show how to open client/server terminals correctly in it!

👉 To open the client folder in VS Code’s terminal:
In VS Code, go to the Explorer panel on the left.

Right-click on the client folder.

Click “Open in Integrated Terminal” from the menu.
