How to create an ngrok public URL to share your local app
Step 1: Run your React frontend (localhost:3000)
bash
Copy
Edit
cd "C:\projects\Ve Meet\client"
npm start
Your React app runs here:
➡️ http://localhost:3000

Step 2: Run your backend server (if any, e.g., localhost:5000)
bash
Copy
Edit
cd "C:\projects\Ve Meet\server"
node server.js
Backend server runs here:
➡️ https://localhost:5000

Step 3: Open a new terminal for ngrok
Navigate to your ngrok folder (or just open terminal if ngrok is in PATH)

Step 4: Start ngrok tunnel for frontend
bash
Copy
Edit
ngrok http 3000
This will give you a public HTTPS URL, e.g.:
➡️ https://abc1234.ngrok-free.app

Step 5: Share this ngrok URL
Anyone with this URL can now access your React app running on your local machine!

Step 6: When done, stop ngrok with Ctrl+C in terminal

[Your PC]
   ├── React App (localhost:3000)
   ├── Backend Server (localhost:5000)
   └── ngrok (tunnel)
           ↓
         Public Internet
           ↓
[Anyone with your ngrok URL]  --->  https://abc1234.ngrok-free.app  --->  Your React App (localhost:3000)
Notes:
If you want to expose backend (port 5000) to public too, open another terminal and run:

yaml
Copy
Edit
ngrok http 5000
The ngrok URL changes every time you start it (unless you have paid plan).

If you want, I can help you create a simple script to start everything quickly next time!

Let me know if you want me to explain any step in detail!

Great! I’ll help you create a simple batch script on Windows that will:

Start your backend server (on port 5000)

Start your frontend React app (on port 3000)

Open ngrok tunnels for both ports (3000 and 5000)

Show the public URLs from ngrok
